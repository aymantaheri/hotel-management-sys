# Hotel Management System - Project Delivery Summary

## Project Overview

The Hotel Management System is a comprehensive, intelligent application built using modern microservices architecture. This system provides a complete solution for hotel operations, including room management, reservations, user authentication, and administrative functions.



### Microservices Architecture
- **Authentication Service** (Port 3001): User management and JWT authentication
- **Room Management Service** (Port 3002): Room inventory and availability
- **Reservation Service** (Port 3003): Booking management and payment processing

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: NestJS (TypeScript), GraphQL, MongoDB, Redis, Kafka
- **Frontend**: React 18, Tailwind CSS, Apollo Client
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Prometheus, Grafana
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, k6 for load testing
